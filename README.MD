## Game Introduction:
### *Become a detective and solve mysteries!*
Welcome to ARTICLEUS, the ultimate detective challenge where your investigative skills will be put to the test! Step 
into the shoes of a detective and solve mysteries by navigating through a web of knowledge. Your mission? To uncover 
the correct target article using clues, logic, and a bit of luck. Choose a category, follow the leads, and see if you 
have what it takes to solve the case before your rivals do. The fewer clues you use, the sharper your detective 
instincts prove to be. Ready to put your skills to the test? Let the investigation begin!
